# WEATHER APP

<h1>Hello there!</h1>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my Git repository. Here, you'll find the source code for a weather application that I've been working on. Unfortunately, in this version, the API is not included due to limited request usages. However, you can still check the weather by visiting my website at <a href="https://weather.jxshua.tech/" target="_blank">https://weather.jxshua.tech/</a>.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in modifying the code and using your own API key, please follow the steps below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the code directly from GitHub.</li>
    <li>Extract the code and open it in a text editor (I prefer Visual Studio Code).</li>
    <li>Open the <code>index.js</code> file and go to line 9 where it says <code>const APIKey = 'yourapi'</code>.</li>
    <li>Replace <code>'yourapi'</code> with the API key you obtain from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank">https://openweathermap.org/</a> (remember to keep it private).</li>
    <li>Save the changes and run the application.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>That's it! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.</p>
